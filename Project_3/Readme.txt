Hi Pradeep!!

As give a change to implement in Python or Scala we choose to implement in Scala.

After downloading zip file from eLC unzip the file and go through the folders.
Main folder Project 3 has four different files i.e. Timeseries.scala, covid_19_weekly.csv,report and Readme.txt

Timeseries.scala file has three executable methods named RMwalk, AR1 and AR2 for Random walk, AR1 and AR2 respectively.

If you are facing any issue with dataloading you might need to change the path of the covid datafile.

After executing each method you will be getting the results along with prediction graphs and we have also documented the results in report.
