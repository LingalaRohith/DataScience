Hi Pradeep!!

After downloading zip file from eLC unzip the file and go through the folders.
Main folder Project 1 has three different folders and one report file.

Scala : This folder has .scala files with each dataset has their file names download them and place in modeling under scalation folder which you will get in set up of scalation 2.0.

Python: This folder has .ipynb files which can be executed in juypter or vscode. Open the file in any of the application and add kernel with python 3.9 or 3.11 and execute.

Data:  This folder has datasets place them in the data folder in scalation2.0 folder which are used in .scala files.

If you are placing data folder in someother location kindly change the path in the code

This is our attempt at analysing all 3 of the data sets and finding the best Neural Net to predict the y variable in Python and Scalation. Our report is thorough and includes all of the necessary information that lead us to our conclusions. The report is concise and shows our thought process on the data set analysis and the paths we took to reach the best features for our performing models. We are looking forward to your feedback and learning/improving for future projects and development of data science skills. Enclosed is all of the code and reporting that has been completed thus far. Feel free to reach out to any of us about further questions or clarification.

Python Requirements
We have used tensorflow and keras to implement the 2L,3L and XL neural nets

Code Details
Autompg.ipynb--This file contains the implementation of 2L, 3L and five layer neural net on Autompg dataset
SeoulBikeData.ipynb--This file contains the implementation of 2L, 3L and five layer neural net on Seoul bike dataset
airfoil.ipynb--This file contains the implementation of 2L, 3L and five layer neural net on Airfoil dataset

Airfoil_NN.scala--This file contains the implementation of 2L, 3L and XL layer neural net on Airfoil dataset
Autompg_NN.scala--This file contains the implementation of 2L, 3L and XL layer neural net on Autompg dataset
Seoul_Bike_NN.scala--This file contains the implementation of 2L, 3L and XL layer neural net on Seoul bike dataset

Bonus 1 : Feature Selection - Implemented for all three datasets.  

Note: As discussed with the professor and agreed on implementing Feature selection for AutoMPG would be fine. Whereas we implemented for all three however provided results for only Airfoil and AutoMPG here.

Bonus 2 : Random Forest Regressor
It has been implemented in both Scala and Python and results has been reported here.
